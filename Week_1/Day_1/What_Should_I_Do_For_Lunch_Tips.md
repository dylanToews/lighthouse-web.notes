### Tips 

Using eslint was a great way to format my code to look better

Work on code iteratively (In small pieces)

Using three backticks allows me to write nown snippits of code in Markdown. See below. Super useful and it's also what theyre asking for in the forum


```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
